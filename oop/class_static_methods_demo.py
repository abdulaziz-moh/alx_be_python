# Note for you:
# Understand the use of @staticmethod for functions that perform a task in isolation, without needing access to class or instance-specific data.
# Grasp the concept of @classmethod for functions that need to access class attributes or methods and understand how the cls parameter allows access to class-level attributes.
# This task underscores the distinction between class methods and static methods in Python, providing clarity on their appropriate use cases and advantages.
